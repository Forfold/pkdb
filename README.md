# Pokemon Scarlet & Violet DB

[Google Sheets View of Stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RzFqFiloiKv04dlDN35yVrymWUaDbb4oktfWDKhTITM/edit?usp=sharing)

Web scraper for Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. I wanted a data table of stats for only Violet and couldn't find it. I also wanted to sort by multiple columns.

Output is in `svpkdx.csv` or `svpkdx.json`

## Development

Run `npx playwright test "index.spec.ts"` to regenerate both files
